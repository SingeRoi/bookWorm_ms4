            "context": "(_Kept in shorthand._)\n\n\n_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\nrule.\n\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\nwaiter, and he said it was called \"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\ndon't know how I should be able to get on without it.\n\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\ntravels with Mina.\n\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\nmust ask the Count all about them.)\n\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\nwhich they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\nvery excellent dish, which they call \"impletata.\" (_Mem._, get recipe\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\n\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\nself-assertion.\n\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.\n\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\nsaid, \"The Herr Englishman?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\" She\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\na letter:--\n\n     \"My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\n\n\"Your friend,\n\n\"DRACULA.\"\n\n\n_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\ncomforting.\n\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\nvery hysterical way:\n\n\"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\" She was in such an excited\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\nshe asked again:\n\n\"Do you know what day it is?\" I answered that it was the fourth of May.\nShe shook her head as she said again:\n\n\"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\" On\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\n\n\"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\"\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\nrosary round my neck, and said, \"For your mother's sake,\" and went out\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\ncoach!"

            "context": "_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\ncalled \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\nstyle of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\n\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\n\"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\ncheering to me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--Satan, \"pokol\"--hell,\n\"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\nsuperstitions)\n\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\nthe whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\nour journey.\n\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\ngreen hills of what they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran the road,\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\n\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\nbe right before us:--\n\n\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God's seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.\n\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\nbut the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\napproving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\nbefore you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\npause to light his lamps.\n\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\nthought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\nin German worse than my own:--\n\n\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\nthe next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\nof themselves, a cal\u00e8che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\n\n\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\n\n\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\n\n\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--\n\n    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\n    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\n\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\nluggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\nhanded out and put in the cal\u00e8che. Then I descended from the side of the\ncoach, as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\nexcellent German:--\n\n\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\n\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\njump from the cal\u00e8che and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\n\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\naround us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\n\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\ntheir true import.\n\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\ncal\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\n\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che, and the\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\nsky."

            "context": "_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\n\nWhen the cal\u00e8che stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\nof the dark openings.\n\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\nwait the coming of the morning.\n\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.\n\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\n\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\n\n\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\nhappiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\n\n\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\n\n\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\nprotested but he insisted:--\n\n\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\nflamed and flared.\n\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\ndoor:--\n\n\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"\n\nThe light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\ntoilet, I went into the other room.\n\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\n\n\"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"\n\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\npleasure.\n\n\"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\nyour instructions in all matters.\"\n\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\nexperienced.\n\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\nphysiognomy.\n\nHis face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\n\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes\ngleamed, and he said:--\n\n\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\"\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\nadded:--\n\n\"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\nhunter.\" Then he rose and said:--\n\n\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\nso sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\n\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\nsake of those dear to me!"

            "context": "_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\nwas written:--\n\n\"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.\" I set to and\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\nthe castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\n\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\nLondon Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\nLaw List.\n\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\nnight's rest. Then he went on:--\n\n\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\nwill interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of\nthe books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"\n\n\"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed\ngravely.\n\n\"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\nspeaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\nimportant affairs in hand.\"\n\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and\nadded:--\n\n\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\" I said I was sure of\nthis, and then he went on:--\n\n\"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\nwhat strange things there may be.\"\n\nThis led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\ntalk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\nfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\nhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\nflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\ncertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\nare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\nwhere treasure has been concealed. \"That treasure has been hidden,\" he\nwent on, \"in the region through which you came last night, there can be\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\nWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\nin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\npatriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\nsheltered in the friendly soil.\"\n\n\"But how,\" said I, \"can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\"\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\n\n\"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\nappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\ncan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\nwould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\nmarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\neven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\nfind these places again?\"\n\n\"There you are right,\" I said. \"I know no more than the dead where even\nto look for them.\" Then we drifted into other matters.\n\n\"Come,\" he said at last, \"tell me of London and of the house which you\nhave procured for me.\" With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\nown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\npassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\nin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I\ncame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\nwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\neverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\nsurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\nmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\n\n\"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\nfall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\nJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"\n\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\ninscribe here:--\n\n\"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\nrust.\n\n\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\nperiods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"\n\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\n\n\"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.\n\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\nYorkshire coast.\n\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he\nsaid; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\nam informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\n\n\"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\nus,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\n\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\nwritten of this day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\nat once how I stand--or seem to.\n\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\nand heard the Count's voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\n\n\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more\ndangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving\nglass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!\" and\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\n\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\nthe forests.\n\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\nan available exit.\n\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!"

            "context": "There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been\nwandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but\nsince dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold\nwinter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so\npenetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.\n\nI was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\nafternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with\nnipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,\nthe nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to\nEliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\n\nThe said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama\nin the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with\nher darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)\nlooked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;\nsaying, \"She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a\ndistance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her\nown observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a\nmore sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly\nmanner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really\nmust exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,\nlittle children.\"\n\n\"What does Bessie say I have done?\" I asked.\n\n\"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something\ntruly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be\nseated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.\"\n\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It\ncontained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care\nthat it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-\nseat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having\ndrawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double\nretirement.\n\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left\nwere the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the\ndrear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my\nbook, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a\npale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat\nshrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and\nlamentable blast.\n\nI returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress\nthereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were\ncertain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite\nas a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of\n\"the solitary rocks and promontories\" by them only inhabited; of the\ncoast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the\nLindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--\n\n   \"Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\n   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles\n   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\n   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.\"\n\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,\nSiberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with \"the vast\nsweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that\nreservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation\nof centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround\nthe pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.\"  Of\nthese death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all\nthe half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,\nbut strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages\nconnected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance\nto the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken\nboat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing\nthrough bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.\n\nI cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with\nits inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,\ngirdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the\nhour of eventide.\n\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.\n\nThe fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over\nquickly: it was an object of terror.\n\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant\ncrowd surrounding a gallows.\n\nEach picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\nunderstanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as\ninteresting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,\nwhen she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her\nironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and\nwhile she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap\nborders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure\ntaken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I\ndiscovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.\n\nWith Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I\nfeared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-\nroom door opened.\n\n\"Boh!  Madam Mope!\" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he\nfound the room apparently empty.\n\n\"Where the dickens is she!\" he continued.  \"Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to\nhis sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad\nanimal!\"\n\n\"It is well I drew the curtain,\" thought I; and I wished fervently he\nmight not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out\nhimself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just\nput her head in at the door, and said at once--\n\n\"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.\"\n\nAnd I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged\nforth by the said Jack.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, with awkward diffidence.\n\n\"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'\" was the answer.  \"I want you to\ncome here;\" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a\ngesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\n\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,\nfor I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and\nunwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and\nlarge extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him\nbilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought\nnow to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month\nor two, \"on account of his delicate health.\"  Mr. Miles, the master,\naffirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats\nsent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so\nharsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's\nsallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after\nhome.\n\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy\nto me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,\nnor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared\nhim, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.\nThere were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,\nbecause I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his\ninflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by\ntaking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the\nsubject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did\nboth now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind\nher back.\n\nHabitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three\nminutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without\ndamaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the\nblow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would\npresently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all\nat once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,\nand on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his\nchair.\n\n\"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,\" said he,\n\"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look\nyou had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!\"\n\nAccustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;\nmy care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the\ninsult.\n\n\"What were you doing behind the curtain?\" he asked.\n\n\"I was reading.\"\n\n\"Show the book.\"\n\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence.\n\n\"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;\nyou have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not\nto live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we\ndo, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to\nrummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,\nor will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of\nthe mirror and the windows.\"\n\nI did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him\nlift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively\nstarted aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume\nwas flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and\ncutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its\nclimax; other feelings succeeded.\n\n\"Wicked and cruel boy!\" I said.  \"You are like a murderer--you are like a\nslave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!\"\n\nI had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of\nNero, Caligula, etc.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never\nthought thus to have declared aloud.\n\n\"What! what!\" he cried.  \"Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,\nEliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--\"\n\nHe ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had\nclosed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.\nI felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was\nsensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time\npredominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very\nwell know what I did with my hands, but he called me \"Rat!  Rat!\" and\nbellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for\nMrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed\nby Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--\n\n\"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!\"\n\n\"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!\"\n\nThen Mrs. Reed subjoined--\n\n\"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.\"  Four hands were\nimmediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs."

            "context": "I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which\ngreatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed\nto entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather\n_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's\nmutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any\nother rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.\n\n\"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.\"\n\n\"For shame! for shame!\" cried the lady's-maid.  \"What shocking conduct,\nMiss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your\nyoung master.\"\n\n\"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?\"\n\n\"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.\nThere, sit down, and think over your wickedness.\"\n\nThey had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,\nand had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a\nspring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\n\n\"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,\" said Bessie.  \"Miss\nAbbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.\"\n\nMiss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This\npreparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a\nlittle of the excitement out of me.\n\n\"Don't take them off,\" I cried; \"I will not stir.\"\n\nIn guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\n\n\"Mind you don't,\" said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was\nreally subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot\nstood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as\nincredulous of my sanity.\n\n\"She never did so before,\" at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\n\n\"But it was always in her,\" was the reply.  \"I've told Missis often my\nopinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand\nlittle thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.\"\n\nBessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--\"You ought to\nbe aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps\nyou: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.\"\n\nI had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very\nfirst recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This\nreproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very\npainful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--\n\n\"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed\nand Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with\nthem.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it\nis your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to\nthem.\"\n\n\"What we tell you is for your good,\" added Bessie, in no harsh voice,\n\"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have\na home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you\naway, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Miss Abbot, \"God will punish her: He might strike her\ndead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,\nBessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say\nyour prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't\nrepent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and\nfetch you away.\"\n\nThey went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\n\nThe red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say\nnever, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall\nrendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it\ncontained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the\nmansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with\ncurtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;\nthe two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half\nshrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;\nthe table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the\nwalls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,\nthe toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out\nof these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-\nup mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles\ncounterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair\nnear the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and\nlooking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\n\nThis room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because\nremote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be\nso seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe\nfrom the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed\nherself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain\nsecret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her\njewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last\nwords lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely\nin spite of its grandeur.\n\nMr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his\nlast; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the\nundertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had\nguarded it from frequent intrusion.\n\nMy seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,\nwas a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;\nto my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken\nreflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled\nwindows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty\nof the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the\ndoor; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no\njail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-\nglass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.\nAll looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:\nand the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and\narms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all\nelse was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of\nthe tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories\nrepresented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing\nbefore the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.\n\nSuperstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for\ncomplete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave\nwas still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush\nof retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.\n\nAll John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,\nall his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my\ndisturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always\nsuffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why\ncould I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?\nEliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had\na spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,\nwas universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,\nseemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase\nindemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;\nthough he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,\nset the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,\nand broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called\nhis mother \"old girl,\" too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,\nsimilar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore\nand spoiled her silk attire; and he was still \"her own darling.\"  I dared\ncommit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty\nand tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to\nnight.\n\nMy head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no\none had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned\nagainst him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with\ngeneral opprobrium.\n\n\"Unjust!--unjust!\" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into\nprecocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,\ninstigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable\noppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never\neating or drinking more, and letting myself die.\n\nWhat a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my\nbrain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what\ndarkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could\nnot answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at\nthe distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.\n\nI was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing\nin harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If\nthey did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not\nbound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one\namongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in\ncapacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their\ninterest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the\ngerms of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I\nknow that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,\nromping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would\nhave endured my presence more complacently; her children would have\nentertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants\nwould have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.\n\nDaylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the\nbeclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain\nstill beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling\nin the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then\nmy courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn\ndepression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was\nwicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just\nconceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and\nwas I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church\nan inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie\nburied; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with\ngathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own\nuncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant\nto his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of\nMrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.\nMrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,\nI dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she\nreally like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,\nafter her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to\nfind herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a\nparent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial\nalien permanently intruded on her own family group.\n\nA singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if\nMr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I\nsat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also\nturning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror--I began to\nrecall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the\nviolation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the\nperjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,\nharassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its\nabode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the\ndeparted--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and\nhushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a\npreternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed\nface, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in\ntheory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I\nendeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from\nmy eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;\nat this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a\nray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight\nwas still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling\nand quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak\nof light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some\none across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken\nas my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a\nherald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my\nhead grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of\nwings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance\nbroke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.\nSteps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and\nAbbot entered.\n\n\"Miss Eyre, are you ill?\" said Bessie.\n\n\"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!\" exclaimed Abbot.\n\n\"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!\" was my cry.\n\n\"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?\" again demanded\nBessie.\n\n\"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.\"  I had now got\nhold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\n\n\"She has screamed out on purpose,\" declared Abbot, in some disgust.  \"And\nwhat a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,\nbut she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.\"\n\n\"What is all this?\" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed\ncame along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.\n\"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left\nin the red-room till I came to her myself.\"\n\n\"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,\" pleaded Bessie.\n\n\"Let her go,\" was the only answer.  \"Loose Bessie's hand, child: you\ncannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor\nartifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks\nwill not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on\ncondition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you\nthen.\"\n\n\"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished\nsome other way!  I shall be killed if--\"\n\n\"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:\" and so, no doubt, she\nfelt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on\nme as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous\nduplicity.\n\nBessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic\nanguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without\nfarther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,\nI suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene."

            "context": "The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a\nfrightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed\nwith thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow\nsound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,\nuncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my\nfaculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;\nlifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more\ntenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head\nagainst a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\n\nIn five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite\nwell that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery\nfire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-\nfoot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my\npillow, leaning over me.\n\nI felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and\nsecurity, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an\nindividual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.\nTurning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me\nthan that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the\nface of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,\nsometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for\nherself and the children she employed a physician.\n\n\"Well, who am I?\" he asked.\n\nI pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,\nsmiling and saying, \"We shall do very well by-and-by.\"  Then he laid me\ndown, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was\nnot disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,\nand intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my\ngrief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near\nmy pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and\nmy heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.\n\n\"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?\" asked Bessie, rather softly.\n\nScarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be\nrough.  \"I will try.\"\n\n\"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Bessie.\"\n\n\"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you\nmay call me if you want anything in the night.\"\n\nWonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.\n\n\"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?\"\n\n\"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better\nsoon, no doubt.\"\n\nBessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her\nsay--\n\n\"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be\nalone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange\nthing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was\nrather too hard.\"\n\nSarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering\ntogether for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of\ntheir conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer\nthe main subject discussed.\n\n\"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished\"--\"A great\nblack dog behind him\"--\"Three loud raps on the chamber door\"--\"A light in\nthe churchyard just over his grave,\" etc., etc.\n\nAt last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the\nwatches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by\ndread: such dread as children only can feel.\n\nNo severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-\nroom; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to\nthis day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental\nsuffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:\nwhile rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my\nbad propensities.\n\nNext day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by\nthe nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse\nailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which\nkept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop\nfrom my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have\nbeen happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in\nthe carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,\nand Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and\narranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted\nkindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of\npeace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless\nfagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no\ncalm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.\n\nBessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart\non a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,\nnestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in\nme a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often\npetitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more\nclosely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a\nprivilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was\ncordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain\nfavour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished\nfor, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,\nthe tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and\ntart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as\na transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from\nthe library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I\nconsidered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of\ninterest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,\nhaving sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under\nmushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at\nlength made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of\nEngland to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,\nand the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in\nmy creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might\none day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,\nhouses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds\nof the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,\nthe monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when\nthis cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its\nleaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,\nnever failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt\ngoblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most\ndesolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the\nbook, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the\nuntasted tart.\n\nBessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed\nher hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of\nsilk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.\nMeantime she sang: her song was--\n\n   \"In the days when we went gipsying,\n      A long time ago.\"\n\nI had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for\nBessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her\nvoice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.\nSometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very\nlingeringly; \"A long time ago\" came out like the saddest cadence of a\nfuneral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful\none.\n\n   \"My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;\n      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;\n   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary\n      Over the path of the poor orphan child.\n\n   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,\n      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?\n   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only\n      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.\n\n   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,\n      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,\n   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,\n      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.\n\n   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,\n      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,\n   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,\n      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.\n\n   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,\n      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;\n   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;\n      God is a friend to the poor orphan child.\"\n\n\"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry,\" said Bessie as she finished.  She might as\nwell have said to the fire, \"don't burn!\" but how could she divine the\nmorbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.\nLloyd came again.\n\n\"What, already up!\" said he, as he entered the nursery.  \"Well, nurse,\nhow is she?\"\n\nBessie answered that I was doing very well.\n\n\"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name\nis Jane, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.\"\n\n\"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?\nHave you any pain?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in\nthe carriage,\" interposed Bessie.\n\n\"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.\"\n\nI thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I\nanswered promptly, \"I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate\ngoing out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable.\"\n\n\"Oh fie, Miss!\" said Bessie.\n\nThe good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before\nhim; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;\nnot very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a\nhard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at\nleisure, he said--\n\n\"What made you ill yesterday?\"\n\n\"She had a fall,\" said Bessie, again putting in her word.\n\n\"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her\nage?  She must be eight or nine years old.\"\n\n\"I was knocked down,\" was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by\nanother pang of mortified pride; \"but that did not make me ill,\" I added;\nwhile Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\n\nAs he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for\nthe servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  \"That's for you, nurse,\" said\nhe; \"you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.\"\n\nBessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because\npunctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\n\n\"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?\" pursued Mr. Lloyd when\nBessie was gone.\n\n\"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.\"\n\nI saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\n\n\"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?\"\n\n\"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.\nNeither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can\nhelp it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel\nthat I think I shall never forget it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in\ndaylight?\"\n\n\"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am\nunhappy,--very unhappy, for other things.\"\n\n\"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?\"\n\nHow much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was\nto frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their\nfeelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know\nnot how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,\nof losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by\nimparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,\nthough, as far as it went, true response.\n\n\"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.\"\n\n\"You have a kind aunt and cousins.\"\n\nAgain I paused; then bunglingly enounced--\n\n\"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.\"\n\nMr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.\n\n\"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?\" asked he.  \"Are\nyou not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?\"\n\n\"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here\nthan a servant.\"\n\n\"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?\"\n\n\"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can\nnever get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?\"\n\n\"I think not, sir.\"\n\n\"None belonging to your father?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might\nhave some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about\nthem.\"\n\n\"If you had such, would you like to go to them?\"\n\nI reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to\nchildren: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable\npoverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,\nscanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty\nfor me was synonymous with degradation.\n\n\"No; I should not like to belong to poor people,\" was my reply.\n\n\"Not even if they were kind to you?\"\n\nI shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being\nkind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be\nuneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing\ntheir children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the\nvillage of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at\nthe price of caste.\n\n\"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly\nset: I should not like to go a begging.\"\n\n\"Would you like to go to school?\"\n\nAgain I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes\nspoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore\nbackboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John\nReed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were\nno rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered\nfrom the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to\nGateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain\naccomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,\nequally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and\nflowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could\nplay, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;\ntill my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school\nwould be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire\nseparation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.\n\n\"I should indeed like to go to school,\" was the audible conclusion of my\nmusings.\n\n\"Well, well! who knows what may happen?\" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.\n\"The child ought to have change of air and scene,\" he added, speaking to\nhimself; \"nerves not in a good state.\"\n\nBessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up\nthe gravel-walk.\n\n\"Is that your mistress, nurse?\" asked Mr. Lloyd.  \"I should like to speak\nto her before I go.\"\n\nBessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.\nIn the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,\nfrom after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my\nbeing sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough\nadopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when\nboth sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as\nthey thought, asleep, \"Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid\nof such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she\nwere watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.\"  Abbot, I think,\ngave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.\n\nOn that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's\ncommunications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that\nmy mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who\nconsidered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so\nirritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that\nafter my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the\ntyphus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town\nwhere his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:\nthat my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month\nof each other.\n\nBessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, \"Poor Miss Jane\nis to be pitied, too, Abbot.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded Abbot; \"if she were a nice, pretty child, one might\ncompassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a\nlittle toad as that.\"\n\n\"Not a great deal, to be sure,\" agreed Bessie: \"at any rate, a beauty\nlike Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.\"\n\n\"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!\" cried the fervent Abbot.  \"Little\ndarling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour\nas she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh\nrabbit for supper.\"\n\n\"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down.\"  They went."

            "context": "From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference\nbetween Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a\nmotive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and\nwaited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had\nregained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the\nsubject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a\nsevere eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a\nmore marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;\nappointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take\nmy meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins\nwere constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop\nabout sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that\nshe would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her\nglance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable\nand rooted aversion.\n\nEliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as\nlittle as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw\nme, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against\nhim, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which\nhad stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran\nfrom me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had\nindeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles\ncould inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I\nhad the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he\nwas already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the\ntale of how \"that nasty Jane Eyre\" had flown at him like a mad cat: he\nwas stopped rather harshly--\n\n\"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is\nnot worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters\nshould associate with her.\"\n\nHere, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all\ndeliberating on my words--\n\n\"They are not fit to associate with me.\"\n\nMrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and\naudacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a\nwhirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,\ndared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one\nsyllable during the remainder of the day.\n\n\"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?\" was my scarcely\nvoluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my\ntongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:\nsomething spoke out of me over which I had no control.\n\n\"What?\" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey\neye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,\nand gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or\nfiend.  I was now in for it.\n\n\"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can\npapa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you\nwish me dead.\"\n\nMrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed\nboth my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the\nhiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a\ndoubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a\nroof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging\nin my breast.\n\nNovember, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the\nNew Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;\npresents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From\nevery enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety\nconsisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and\nseeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin\nfrocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and\nafterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played\nbelow, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the\njingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\nhum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When\ntired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the\nsolitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not\nmiserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,\nfor in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind\nand companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings\nquietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of\nMrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon\nas she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the\nlively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing\nthe candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the\nfire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse\nthan myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull\nred, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,\nand sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I\nalways took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth\nof worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in\nloving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature\nscarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I\ndoated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of\nsensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and\nwhen it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it\nto be happy likewise.\n\nLong did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and\nlistened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she\nwould come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or\nperhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a\ncheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had\nfinished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,\nand said, \"Good night, Miss Jane.\"  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me\nthe best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most\nintensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never\npush me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often\nwont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural\ncapacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of\nnarrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her\nnursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and\nperson are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black\nhair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she\nhad a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or\njustice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at\nGateshead Hall.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:\nBessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned\nto their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go\nand feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less\nso of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she\nthus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for\nsaving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in\ndriving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and\nslips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of\nhis young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and\nEliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a\nhandsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd\ncorners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards\nhaving been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing\nher valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious\nrate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted\nevery quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious\naccuracy.\n\nGeorgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and\ninterweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of\nwhich she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my\nbed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before\nshe returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-\nnurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the\nquilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in\norder some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an\nabrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny\nchairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped\nmy proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to\nbreathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and\nthus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the\ngrounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard\nfrost.\n\nFrom this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,\nand just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling\nthe panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a\ncarriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with\nindifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought\nvisitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the\ndoor-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being\nnothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the\nspectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs\nof the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.\nThe remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and\nhaving crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out\nthe crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the\nnursery.\n\n\"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you\nwashed your hands and face this morning?\"  I gave another tug before I\nanswered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash\nyielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the\ncherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--\n\n\"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.\"\n\n\"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite\nred, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the\nwindow for?\"\n\nI was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a\nhurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,\ninflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with\nsoap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly\nbrush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the\nstairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.\n\nI would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was\nthere; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon\nme.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been\ncalled to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the\nbreakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on\nwhich it dismayed me to intrude.\n\nI now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and\nI stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon\nhad fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I\nfeared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;\nten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the\nbreakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.\n\n\"Who could want me?\" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the\nstiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  \"What\nshould I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?\"  The\nhandle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,\nI looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first\nsight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:\nthe grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft\nby way of capital.\n\nMrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to\nme to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger\nwith the words: \"This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to\nyou.\"\n\n_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and\nhaving examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which\ntwinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,\n\"Her size is small: what is her age?\"\n\n\"Ten years.\"\n\n\"So much?\" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for\nsome minutes.  Presently he addressed me--\"Your name, little girl?\"\n\n\"Jane Eyre, sir.\"\n\nIn uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;\nbut then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the\nlines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\n\n\"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?\"\n\nImpossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a\ncontrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an\nexpressive shake of the head, adding soon, \"Perhaps the less said on that\nsubject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.\"\n\n\"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;\" and bending\nfrom the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite\nMrs. Reed's.  \"Come here,\" he said.\n\nI stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.\nWhat a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a\ngreat nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!\n\n\"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,\" he began, \"especially a\nnaughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?\"\n\n\"They go to hell,\" was my ready and orthodox answer.\n\n\"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"A pit full of fire.\"\n\n\"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for\never?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"What must you do to avoid it?\"\n\nI deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:\n\"I must keep in good health, and not die.\"\n\n\"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I\nburied a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good\nlittle child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same\ncould not be said of you were you to be called hence.\"\n\nNot being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on\nthe two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far\nenough away.\n\n\"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having\nbeen the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.\"\n\n\"Benefactress! benefactress!\" said I inwardly: \"they all call Mrs. Reed\nmy benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.\"\n\n\"Do you say your prayers night and morning?\" continued my interrogator.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you read your Bible?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?\"\n\n\"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and\na little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job\nand Jonah.\"\n\n\"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six\nPsalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a\ngingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the\nverse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little\nangel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant\npiety.\"\n\n\"Psalms are not interesting,\" I remarked.\n\n\"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change\nit: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and\ngive you a heart of flesh.\"\n\nI was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that\noperation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed\ninterposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the\nconversation herself.\n\n\"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to\nyou three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character\nand disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I\nshould be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep\na strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a\ntendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may\nnot attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.\"\n\nWell might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature\nto wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully\nI obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were\nstill repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered\nbefore a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived\nthat she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence\nwhich she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed\nthe feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future\npath; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an\nartful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?\n\n\"Nothing, indeed,\" thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and\nhastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\n\n\"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,\" said Mr. Brocklehurst; \"it\nis akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake\nburning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.\nReed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.\"\n\n\"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,\"\ncontinued my benefactress; \"to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for\nthe vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at\nLowood.\"\n\n\"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,\" returned Mr.\nBrocklehurst.  \"Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly\nappropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial\ncare shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied\nhow best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the\nother day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,\nAugusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she\nexclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood\nlook, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,\nand those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost\nlike poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and\nmama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'\"\n\n\"This is the state of things I quite approve,\" returned Mrs. Reed; \"had I\nsought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more\nexactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.\nBrocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.\"\n\n\"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been\nobserved in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:\nplain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and\nactive habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its\ninhabitants.\"\n\n\"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a\npupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position\nand prospects?\"\n\n\"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,\nand I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege\nof her election.\"\n\n\"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I\nassure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was\nbecoming too irksome.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall\nreturn to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good\nfriend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall\nsend Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there\nwill be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,\nand to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.\"\n\n\"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's\nGuide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account\nof the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to\nfalsehood and deceit.'\"\n\nWith these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn\nin a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.\n\nMrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was\nsewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or\nseven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and\nstrong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat\nlarge face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow\nwas low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently\nregular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her\nskin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was\nsound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever\nmanager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;\nher children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;\nshe dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off\nhandsome attire.\n\nSitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her\nfigure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing\nthe sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been\npointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.\nReed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their\nconversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every\nword as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment\nfomented now within me.\n\nMrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers\nat the same time suspended their nimble movements.\n\n\"Go out of the room; return to the nursery,\" was her mandate.  My look or\nsomething else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with\nextreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I\ncame back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up\nto her.\n\n_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?\nWhat strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my\nenergies and launched them in this blunt sentence--\n\n\"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I\ndo not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except\nJohn Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,\nGeorgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.\"\n\nMrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice\ncontinued to dwell freezingly on mine.\n\n\"What more have you to say?\" she asked, rather in the tone in which a\nperson might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily\nused to a child.\n\nThat eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from\nhead to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--\n\n\"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again\nas long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and\nif any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say\nthe very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with\nmiserable cruelty.\"\n\n\"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?\"\n\n\"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You\nthink I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or\nkindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember\nhow you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the\nred-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;\nthough I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have\nmercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your\nwicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody\nwho asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,\nbut you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!\"\n\n{How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}\n\nEre I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with\nthe strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if\nan invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-\nfor liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked\nfrightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her\nhands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she\nwould cry.\n\n\"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you\ntremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Reed.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be\nyour friend.\"\n\n\"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful\ndisposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what\nyou have done.\"\n\n\"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for\ntheir faults.\"\n\n\"Deceit is not my fault!\" I cried out in a savage, high voice.\n\n\"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the\nnursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little.\"\n\n\"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.\nReed, for I hate to live here.\"\n\n\"I will indeed send her to school soon,\" murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;\nand gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\n\nI was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I\nhad fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the\nrug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's\nsolitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce\npleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my\npulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot\ngive its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without\nexperiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A\nridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a\nmeet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same\nridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have\nrepresented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's\nsilence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the\ndreariness of my hated and hating position.\n\nSomething of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine\nit seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and\ncorroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly\nwould I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly\nfrom experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her\nrepulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse\nof my nature.\n\nI would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;\nfain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre\nindignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and\nendeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own\nthoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found\nfascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the\nshrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or\nbreeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt\nof my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was\nquite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the\nfalling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept\nby past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a\ngate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where\nthe short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most\nopaque sky, \"onding on snaw,\" canopied all; thence flakes felt it\nintervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without\nmelting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and\nover again, \"What shall I do?--what shall I do?\"\n\nAll at once I heard a clear voice call, \"Miss Jane! where are you?  Come\nto lunch!\"\n\nIt was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step\ncame tripping down the path.\n\n\"You naughty little thing!\" she said.  \"Why don't you come when you are\ncalled?\"\n\nBessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\nbrooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.\nThe fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not\ndisposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_\ndisposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two\narms round her and said, \"Come, Bessie! don't scold.\"\n\nThe action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\nindulge in: somehow it pleased her.\n\n\"You are a strange child, Miss Jane,\" she said, as she looked down at me;\n\"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I\nsuppose?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?\"\n\n\"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me.\"\n\n\"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should\nbe bolder.\"\n\n\"What! to get more knocks?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,\nwhen she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one\nof her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I don't think you have, Bessie.\"\n\n\"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but\nMissis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this\nafternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a\nlittle cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I\nam soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a\nday or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.\"\n\n\"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.\"\n\n\"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of\nme.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so\nprovoking.\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I\nhave got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to\ndread.\"\n\n\"If you dread them they'll dislike you.\"\n\n\"As you do, Bessie?\"\n\n\"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the\nothers.\"\n\n\"You don't show it.\"\n\n\"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What\nmakes you so venturesome and hardy?\"\n\n\"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides\"--I was going to say\nsomething about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second\nthoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\n\n\"And so you're glad to leave me?\"\n\n\"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry.\"\n\n\"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say\nnow if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say\nyou'd _rather_ not.\"\n\n\"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.\"  Bessie stooped; we\nmutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.\nThat afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie\ntold me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her\nsweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine."

            "context": "Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,\nwhen Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and\nnearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had\nwashed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just\nsetting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I\nwas to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates\nat six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in\nthe nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children\ncan eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,\nhaving pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and\nbread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and\nput them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,\nand wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we\npassed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, \"Will you go in and bid Missis good-\nbye?\"\n\n\"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to\nsupper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins\neither; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best\nfriend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.\"\n\n\"What did you say, Miss?\"\n\n\"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to\nthe wall.\"\n\n\"That was wrong, Miss Jane.\"\n\n\"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has\nbeen my foe.\"\n\n\"O Miss Jane! don't say so!\"\n\n\"Good-bye to Gateshead!\" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went\nout at the front door.\n\nThe moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose\nlight glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw\nand chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down\nthe drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,\nwe found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had\nbeen carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It\nwanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,\nthe distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door\nand watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\n\n\"Is she going by herself?\" asked the porter's wife.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And how far is it?\"\n\n\"Fifty miles.\"\n\n\"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far\nalone.\"\n\nThe coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its\ntop laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my\ntrunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung\nwith kisses.\n\n\"Be sure and take good care of her,\" cried she to the guard, as he lifted\nme into the inside.\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed \"All\nright,\" and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;\nthus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and\nmysterious regions.\n\nI remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to\nme of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over\nhundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,\na very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the\npassengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard\nwanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in\nan immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from\nthe ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled\nwith musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling\nvery strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and\nkidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\nfrequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard\nreturned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted\nhis own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the\n\"stony street\" of L-.\n\nThe afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I\nbegan to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we\nceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills\nheaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,\ndark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I\nheard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\n\nLulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered\nwhen the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,\nand a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress\nby the light of the lamps.\n\n\"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?\" she asked.  I answered\n\"Yes,\" and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach\ninstantly drove away.\n\nI was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion\nof the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and\ndarkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me\nand a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she\nshut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or\nhouses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights\nburning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were\nadmitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room\nwith a fire, where she left me alone.\n\nI stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;\nthere was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by\nintervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:\nit was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at\nGateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the\nsubject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual\ncarrying a light entered; another followed close behind.\n\nThe first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large\nforehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was\ngrave, her bearing erect.\n\n\"The child is very young to be sent alone,\" said she, putting her candle\ndown on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,\nthen further added--\n\n\"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?\" she\nasked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"A little, ma'am.\"\n\n\"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to\nbed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to\ncome to school, my little girl?\"\n\nI explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had\nbeen dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,\nwrite, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her\nforefinger, and saying, \"She hoped I should be a good child,\" dismissed\nme along with Miss Miller.\n\nThe lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me\nappeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,\nand air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a\ncareworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always\na multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards\nfound she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from\ncompartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and\nirregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary\nsilence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came\nupon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,\nwith great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of\ncandles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of\nevery age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the\ndips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality\nexceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of\nquaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;\nthey were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I\nhad heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.\n\nMiss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up\nto the top of the long room she cried out--\n\n\"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!\"\n\nFour tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered\nthe books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--\n\n\"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!\"\n\nThe tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with\nportions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher\nof water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed\nround; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common\nto all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not\ntouch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:\nI now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.\n\nThe meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed\noff, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I\nscarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like\nthe schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss\nMiller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced\nat the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two\noccupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst\nsilence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\n\nThe night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once\nawoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in\ntorrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my\nside.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls\nwere up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or\ntwo burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and\nI dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a\nbasin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to\nsix girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell\nrang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the\nstairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were\nread by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--\n\n\"Form classes!\"\n\nA great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\nrepeatedly exclaimed, \"Silence!\" and \"Order!\"  When it subsided, I saw\nthem all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the\nfour tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a\nBible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some\nseconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss\nMiller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\n\nA distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each\nwalked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth\nvacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the\nsmallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was\ncalled, and placed at the bottom of it.\n\nBusiness now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of\nScripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of\nchapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise\nwas terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded\nfor the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another\nroom to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting\nsomething to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so\nlittle the day before.\n\nThe refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables\nsmoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth\nan odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of\ndiscontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\ndestined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of\nthe first class, rose the whispered words--\n\n\"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!\"\n\n\"Silence!\" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the\nupper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of\nsomewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,\nwhile a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her\nI had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller\noccupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,\nforeign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,\ntook the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said\nand a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and\nthe meal began.\n\nRavenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion\nwithout thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I\nperceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as\nbad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons\nwere moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;\nbut in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,\nand none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,\nand a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the\nschoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,\nI saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked\nat the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of\nthem, the stout one, whispered--\n\n\"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!\"\n\nA quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the\nschoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to\nbe permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.\nThe whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused\nroundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller\nwas now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing\nabout her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of\nMr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her\nhead disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general\nwrath; doubtless she shared in it.\n\nA clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and\nstanding in the middle of the room, cried--\n\n\"Silence!  To your seats!\"\n\nDiscipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved\ninto order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.\nThe upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all\nseemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty\ngirls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all\nwith plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown\ndresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,\nwith little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's\npurse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose\nof a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made\nshoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this\ncostume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,\nand gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.\n\nI was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the\nteachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a\nlittle coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and\ngrotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,\nand over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole\nschool rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.\n\nWhat was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I\nhad gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were\nnow turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and\nencountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at\nthe bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each\nend; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss\nMiller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her\nanswer, went back to her place, and said aloud--\n\n\"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!\"\n\nWhile the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly\nup the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I\nretain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.\nSeen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown\neyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long\nlashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her\ntemples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,\naccording to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor\nlong ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was\nof purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;\na gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her\ngirdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a\ncomplexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will\nhave, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the\nexterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name\nwritten in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.\n\nThe superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her\nseat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the\nfirst class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the\nlower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,\ngrammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and\nmusic lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The\nduration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck\ntwelve.  The superintendent rose--\n\n\"I have a word to address to the pupils,\" said she.\n\nThe tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it\nsank at her voice.  She went on--\n\n\"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be\nhungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served\nto all.\"\n\nThe teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\n\n\"It is to be done on my responsibility,\" she added, in an explanatory\ntone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\n\nThe bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the\nhigh delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now\ngiven \"To the garden!\"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings\nof coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly\nequipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\n\nThe garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to\nexclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,\nand broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little\nbeds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,\nand each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless\nlook pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight\nand brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an\ninclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by\na drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the\nfloods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged\nin active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for\nshelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist\npenetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a\nhollow cough.\n\nAs yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;\nI stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;\nit did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,\ndrew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which\nnipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,\ndelivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My\nreflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly\nyet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to\nan immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the\nfuture I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like\ngarden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed\ngrey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the\nschoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,\nwhich gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore\nthis inscription:--\n\n\"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi\nBrocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\"  \"Let your light so\nshine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your\nFather which is in heaven.\"--St. Matt. v. 16.\n\nI read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation\nbelonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was\nstill pondering the signification of \"Institution,\" and endeavouring to\nmake out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,\nwhen the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a\ngirl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the\nperusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the\ntitle--it was \"Rasselas;\" a name that struck me as strange, and\nconsequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and\nI said to her directly--\n\n\"Is your book interesting?\"  I had already formed the intention of asking\nher to lend it to me some day.\n\n\"I like it,\" she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which\nshe examined me.\n\n\"What is it about?\" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the\nhardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was\ncontrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a\nchord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a\nfrivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious\nor substantial.\n\n\"You may look at it,\" replied the girl, offering me the book.\n\nI did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less\ntaking than the title: \"Rasselas\" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw\nnothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed\nspread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she\nreceived it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse\ninto her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--\n\n\"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What\nis Lowood Institution?\"\n\n\"This house where you are come to live.\"\n\n\"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from\nother schools?\"\n\n\"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are\ncharity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your\nfather or your mother dead?\"\n\n\"Both died before I can remember.\"\n\n\"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this\nis called an institution for educating orphans.\"\n\n\"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?\"\n\n\"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.\"\n\n\"Then why do they call us charity-children?\"\n\n\"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the\ndeficiency is supplied by subscription.\"\n\n\"Who subscribes?\"\n\n\"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood\nand in London.\"\n\n\"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?\"\n\n\"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,\nand whose son overlooks and directs everything here.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.\"\n\n\"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and\nwho said we were to have some bread and cheese?\"\n\n\"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.\nBrocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and\nall our clothes.\"\n\n\"Does he live here?\"\n\n\"No--two miles off, at a large hall.\"\n\n\"Is he a good man?\"\n\n\"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.\"\n\n\"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what are the other teachers called?\"\n\n\"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,\nand cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and\neverything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches\nhistory and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one\nwho wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a\nyellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and\nteaches French.\"\n\n\"Do you like the teachers?\"\n\n\"Well enough.\"\n\n\"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot\npronounce her name as you do.\"\n\n\"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame\nPierrot is not a bad sort of person.\"\n\n\"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?\"\n\n\"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because\nshe knows far more than they do.\"\n\n\"Have you been long here?\"\n\n\"Two years.\"\n\n\"Are you an orphan?\"\n\n\"My mother is dead.\"\n\n\"Are you happy here?\"\n\n\"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for\nthe present: now I want to read.\"\n\nBut at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the\nhouse.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more\nappetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the\ndinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong\nsteam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent\npotatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of\nthis preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each\npupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every\nday's fare would be like this.\n\nAfter dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons\nrecommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.\n\nThe only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom\nI had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd\nfrom a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large\nschoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,\nespecially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I\nexpected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my\nsurprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,\nthe central mark of all eyes.  \"How can she bear it so quietly--so\nfirmly?\" I asked of myself.  \"Were I in her place, it seems to me I\nshould wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she\nwere thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:\nof something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is\nshe in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure\nthey do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:\nshe is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really\npresent.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty.\"\n\nSoon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of\ncoffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank\nmy coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was\nstill hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the\nglass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my\nfirst day at Lowood."

            "context": "_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\n\nSt. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17\u2014.\n\n\nYou will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\ncommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\nforebodings.  I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.\n\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this\nfeeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour.  There\u2014for with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigators\u2014there snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purpose\u2014a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas\u2019 library.  My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father\u2019s dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\ngreat enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\nthe greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\n\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\n\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs\u2014a dress which I have\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\nArchangel.\n\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\nor never.\n\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\nlove and kindness.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n\nR. Walton"

            "context": "_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\n\nArchangel, 28th March, 17\u2014.\n\n\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.\n\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas\u2019 books of voyages.\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\n\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\nin my enterprise.\n\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\nwoman\u2019s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\ninclinations. \u201cWhat a noble fellow!\u201d you will exclaim. He is\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\notherwise he would command.\n\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\n\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking.  It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\nI am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to \u201cthe\nland of mist and snow,\u201d but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the \u201cAncient Mariner.\u201d  You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something\nat work in my soul which I do not understand.  I am practically\nindustrious\u2014painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabour\u2014but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.\n\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America?  I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture.  Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits.  I love you very tenderly. \nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n  Robert Walton"

            "context": "It was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the managers of\nthe Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their\nretirement.  Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli, one of the\nprincipal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young ladies of the\nballet, who had come up from the stage after \"dancing\" Polyeucte.  They\nrushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and\nunnatural laughter, others to cries of terror.  Sorelli, who wished to\nbe alone for a moment to \"run through\" the speech which she was to make\nto the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad and\ntumultuous crowd.  It was little Jammes--the girl with the tip-tilted\nnose, the forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white\nneck and shoulders--who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:\n\n\"It's the ghost!\"  And she locked the door.\n\nSorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace\nelegance.  A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard or two\nprovided the necessary furniture.  On the walls hung a few engravings,\nrelics of the mother, who had known the glories of the old Opera in the\nRue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini.  But\nthe room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were\nlodged in common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing,\nquarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying one\nanother glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the call-boy's\nbell rang.\n\nSorelli was very superstitious.  She shuddered when she heard little\nJammes speak of the ghost, called her a \"silly little fool\" and then,\nas she was the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera\nghost in particular, at once asked for details:\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"As plainly as I see you now!\" said little Jammes, whose legs were\ngiving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair.\n\nThereupon little Giry--the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as\nink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor\nlittle bones--little Giry added:\n\n\"If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.\n\nAnd they all began to talk together.  The ghost had appeared to them in\nthe shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood\nbefore them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from.\nHe seemed to have come straight through the wall.\n\n\"Pooh!\" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head.  \"You see\nthe ghost everywhere!\"\n\nAnd it was true.  For several months, there had been nothing discussed\nat the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the\nbuilding, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to\nwhom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one\nknowing how or where.  As became a real ghost, he made no noise in\nwalking.  People began by laughing and making fun of this specter\ndressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend\nsoon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet.  All\nthe girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less\noften.  And those who laughed the loudest were not the most at ease.\nWhen he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing\nby accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held\nhim responsible.  Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical\njoke at the hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it\nwas at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.\n\nAfter all, who had seen him?  You meet so many men in dress-clothes at\nthe Opera who are not ghosts.  But this dress-suit had a peculiarity of\nits own.  It covered a skeleton.  At least, so the ballet-girls said.\nAnd, of course, it had a death's head.\n\nWas all this serious?  The truth is that the idea of the skeleton came\nfrom the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief\nscene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost.  He had run up against\nthe ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to\n\"the cellars.\"  He had seen him for a second--for the ghost had\nfled--and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:\n\n\"He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton\nframe.  His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed pupils.\nYou just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull.  His skin,\nwhich is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but\na nasty yellow.  His nose is so little worth talking about that you\ncan't see it side-face; and THE ABSENCE of that nose is a horrible\nthing TO LOOK AT.  All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks\non his forehead and behind his ears.\"\n\nThis chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at\nimagining things.  His words were received with interest and amazement;\nand soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in\ndress-clothes with a death's head on his shoulders.  Sensible men who\nhad wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the\nvictim of a joke played by one of his assistants.  And then, one after\nthe other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so\ninexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.\n\nFor instance, a fireman is a brave fellow!  He fears nothing, least of\nall fire!  Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round\nof inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little\nfarther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared,\ntrembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically\nfainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.[1]  And why?\nBecause he had seen coming toward him, AT THE LEVEL OF HIS HEAD, BUT\nWITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE!  And, as I said, a\nfireman is not afraid of fire.\n\nThe fireman's name was Pampin.\n\nThe corps de ballet was flung into consternation.  At first sight, this\nfiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description of\nthe ghost.  But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the\nghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased.  And, of\ncourse, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger.\nOnce a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and\nback-row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made\nthem quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill-lighted\ncorridor.  Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the\nfireman, placed a horseshoe on the table in front of the\nstage-door-keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera\notherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the\nfirst tread of the staircase.  This horse-shoe was not invented by\nme--any more than any other part of this story, alas!--and may still be\nseen on the table in the passage outside the stage-door-keeper's box,\nwhen you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de\nl'Administration.\n\nTo return to the evening in question.\n\n\"It's the ghost!\" little Jammes had cried.\n\nAn agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing was\nheard but the hard breathing of the girls.  At last, Jammes, flinging\nherself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real\nterror on her face, whispered:\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nEverybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door.  There was no\nsound of footsteps.  It was like light silk sliding over the panel.\nThen it stopped.\n\nSorelli tried to show more pluck than the others.  She went up to the\ndoor and, in a quavering voice, asked:\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\nBut nobody answered.  Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last\nmovement, she made an effort to show courage, and said very loudly:\n\n\"Is there any one behind the door?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!  Of course there is!\" cried that little dried plum of a\nMeg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt.\n\"Whatever you do, don't open the door!  Oh, Lord, don't open the door!\"\n\nBut Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key\nand drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated to the inner\ndressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:\n\n\"Mother!  Mother!\"\n\nSorelli looked into the passage bravely.  It was empty; a gas-flame, in\nits glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding\ndarkness, without succeeding in dispelling it.  And the dancer slammed\nthe door again, with a deep sigh.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"there is no one there.\"\n\n\"Still, we saw him!\"  Jammes declared, returning with timid little\nsteps to her place beside Sorelli.  \"He must be somewhere prowling\nabout.  I shan't go back to dress.  We had better all go down to the\nfoyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we will come up again\ntogether.\"\n\nAnd the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring which she\nwore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the\ntip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew's cross on the\nwooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand.  She said\nto the little ballet-girls:\n\n\"Come, children, pull yourselves together!  I dare say no one has ever\nseen the ghost.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, we saw him--we saw him just now!\" cried the girls.  \"He had\nhis death's head and his dress-coat, just as when he appeared to Joseph\nBuquet!\"\n\n\"And Gabriel saw him too!\" said Jammes.  \"Only yesterday!  Yesterday\nafternoon--in broad day-light----\"\n\n\"Gabriel, the chorus-master?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, didn't you know?\"\n\n\"And he was wearing his dress-clothes, in broad daylight?\"\n\n\"Who?  Gabriel?\"\n\n\"Why, no, the ghost!\"\n\n\"Certainly!  Gabriel told me so himself.  That's what he knew him by.\nGabriel was in the stage-manager's office.  Suddenly the door opened\nand the Persian entered.  You know the Persian has the evil eye----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" answered the little ballet-girls in chorus, warding off\nill-luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at the absent\nPersian, while their second and third fingers were bent on the palm and\nheld down by the thumb.\n\n\"And you know how superstitious Gabriel is,\" continued Jammes.\n\"However, he is always polite.  When he meets the Persian, he just puts\nhis hand in his pocket and touches his keys.  Well, the moment the\nPersian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump from his chair\nto the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch iron!  In doing so, he tore\na whole skirt of his overcoat on a nail.  Hurrying to get out of the\nroom, he banged his forehead against a hat-peg and gave himself a huge\nbump; then, suddenly stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen,\nnear the piano; he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his\nhands and crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a\nmadman, slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first\nflight on his back.  I was just passing with mother.  We picked him up.\nHe was covered with bruises and his face was all over blood.  We were\nfrightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank\nProvidence that he had got off so cheaply.  Then he told us what had\nfrightened him.  He had seen the ghost behind the Persian, THE GHOST\nWITH THE DEATH'S HEAD just like Joseph Buquet's description!\"\n\nJammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost were at\nher heels, and was quite out of breath at the finish.  A silence\nfollowed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great excitement.  It was\nbroken by little Giry, who said:\n\n\"Joseph Buquet would do better to hold his tongue.\"\n\n\"Why should he hold his tongue?\" asked somebody.\n\n\"That's mother's opinion,\" replied Meg, lowering her voice and looking\nall about her as though fearing lest other ears than those present\nmight overhear.\n\n\"And why is it your mother's opinion?\"\n\n\"Hush!  Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked about.\"\n\n\"And why does your mother say so?\"\n\n\"Because--because--nothing--\"\n\nThis reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies, who\ncrowded round little Giry, begging her to explain herself.  They were\nthere, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously in one movement of\nentreaty and fear, communicating their terror to one another, taking a\nkeen pleasure in feeling their blood freeze in their veins.\n\n\"I swore not to tell!\" gasped Meg.\n\nBut they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret, until Meg,\nburning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes fixed on the door:\n\n\"Well, it's because of the private box.\"\n\n\"What private box?\"\n\n\"The ghost's box!\"\n\n\"Has the ghost a box?  Oh, do tell us, do tell us!\"\n\n\"Not so loud!\" said Meg.  \"It's Box Five, you know, the box on the\ngrand tier, next to the stage-box, on the left.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\"\n\n\"I tell you it is.  Mother has charge of it.  But you swear you won't\nsay a word?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the ghost's box.  No one has had it for over a month,\nexcept the ghost, and orders have been given at the box-office that it\nmust never be sold.\"\n\n\"And does the ghost really come there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then somebody does come?\"\n\n\"Why, no!  The ghost comes, but there is nobody there.\"\n\nThe little ballet-girls exchanged glances.  If the ghost came to the\nbox, he must be seen, because he wore a dress-coat and a death's head.\nThis was what they tried to make Meg understand, but she replied:\n\n\"That's just it!  The ghost is not seen.  And he has no dress-coat and\nno head!  All that talk about his death's head and his head of fire is\nnonsense!  There's nothing in it.  You only hear him when he is in the\nbox.  Mother has never seen him, but she has heard him.  Mother knows,\nbecause she gives him his program.\"\n\nSorelli interfered.\n\n\"Giry, child, you're getting at us!\"\n\nThereupon little Giry began to cry.\n\n\"I ought to have held my tongue--if mother ever came to know!  But I\nwas quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to talk of things that\ndon't concern him--it will bring him bad luck--mother was saying so\nlast night----\"\n\nThere was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the passage and a\nbreathless voice cried:\n\n\"Cecile!  Cecile!  Are you there?\"\n\n\"It's mother's voice,\" said Jammes.  \"What's the matter?\"\n\nShe opened the door.  A respectable lady, built on the lines of a\nPomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing-room and dropped groaning\ninto a vacant arm-chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her brick-dust\ncolored face.\n\n\"How awful!\" she said.  \"How awful!\"\n\n\"What?  What?\"\n\n\"Joseph Buquet!\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"Joseph Buquet is dead!\"\n\nThe room became filled with exclamations, with astonished outcries,\nwith scared requests for explanations.\n\n\"Yes, he was found hanging in the third-floor cellar!\"\n\n\"It's the ghost!\" little Giry blurted, as though in spite of herself;\nbut she at once corrected herself, with her hands pressed to her mouth:\n\"No, no!--I, didn't say it!--I didn't say it!----\"\n\nAll around her, her panic-stricken companions repeated under their\nbreaths:\n\n\"Yes--it must be the ghost!\"\n\nSorelli was very pale.\n\n\"I shall never be able to recite my speech,\" she said.\n\nMa Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of liqueur that\nhappened to be standing on a table; the ghost must have something to do\nwith it.\n\nThe truth is that no one ever knew how Joseph Buquet met his death.\nThe verdict at the inquest was \"natural suicide.\"  In his Memoirs of\nManager, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint managers who succeeded MM.\nDebienne and Poligny, describes the incident as follows:\n\n\"A grievous accident spoiled the little party which MM.  Debienne and\nPoligny gave to celebrate their retirement.  I was in the manager's\noffice, when Mercier, the acting-manager, suddenly came darting in.  He\nseemed half mad and told me that the body of a scene-shifter had been\nfound hanging in the third cellar under the stage, between a farm-house\nand a scene from the Roi de Lahore.  I shouted:\n\n\"'Come and cut him down!'\n\n\"By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's ladder,\nthe man was no longer hanging from his rope!\"\n\nSo this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural.  A man hangs at\nthe end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared.\nOh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation!  Listen to him:\n\n\"It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls lost no\ntime in taking their precautions against the evil eye.\"\n\nThere you are!  Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob's\nladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves in less time\nthan it takes to write!  When, on the other hand, I think of the exact\nspot where the body was discovered--the third cellar underneath the\nstage!--imagine that SOMEBODY must have been interested in seeing that\nthe rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and time will\nshow if I am wrong.\n\nThe horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph Buquet was\nvery popular.  The dressing-rooms emptied and the ballet-girls,\ncrowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around their shepherdess, made\nfor the foyer through the ill-lit passages and staircases, trotting as\nfast as their little pink legs could carry them.\n\n\n[1] I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro\nGailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera."

            "context": "On the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny, who was\ncoming up-stairs. The count, who was generally so calm, seemed greatly\nexcited.\n\n\"I was just going to you,\" he said, taking off his hat.  \"Oh, Sorelli,\nwhat an evening!  And Christine Daae:  what a triumph!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Meg Giry.  \"Six months ago, she used to sing like a\nCROCK!  But do let us get by, my dear count,\" continues the brat, with\na saucy curtsey.  \"We are going to inquire after a poor man who was\nfound hanging by the neck.\"\n\nJust then the acting-manager came fussing past and stopped when he\nheard this remark.\n\n\"What!\" he exclaimed roughly.  \"Have you girls heard already?  Well,\nplease forget about it for tonight--and above all don't let M. Debienne\nand M. Poligny hear; it would upset them too much on their last day.\"\n\nThey all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already full of\npeople.  The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala performance ever\nequalled this one.  All the great composers of the day had conducted\ntheir own works in turns.  Faure and Krauss had sung; and, on that\nevening, Christine Daae had revealed her true self, for the first time,\nto the astonished and enthusiastic audience.  Gounod had conducted the\nFuneral March of a Marionnette; Reyer, his beautiful overture to\nSiguar; Saint Saens, the Danse Macabre and a Reverie Orientale;\nMassenet, an unpublished Hungarian march; Guiraud, his Carnaval;\nDelibes, the Valse Lente from Sylvia and the Pizzicati from Coppelia.\nMlle. Krauss had sung the bolero in the Vespri Siciliani; and Mlle.\nDenise Bloch the drinking song in Lucrezia Borgia.\n\nBut the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daae, who had begun by\nsinging a few passages from Romeo and Juliet.  It was the first time\nthat the young artist sang in this work of Gounod, which had not been\ntransferred to the Opera and which was revived at the Opera Comique\nafter it had been produced at the old Theatre Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho.\nThose who heard her say that her voice, in these passages, was\nseraphic; but this was nothing to the superhuman notes that she gave\nforth in the prison scene and the final trio in FAUST, which she sang\nin the place of La Carlotta, who was ill.  No one had ever heard or\nseen anything like it.\n\nDaae revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a splendor, a\nradiance hitherto unsuspected.  The whole house went mad, rising to its\nfeet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while Christine sobbed and fainted\nin the arms of her fellow-singers and had to be carried to her\ndressing-room. A few subscribers, however, protested.  Why had so great\na treasure been kept from them all that time?  Till then, Christine\nDaae had played a good Siebel to Carlotta's rather too splendidly\nmaterial Margarita.  And it had needed Carlotta's incomprehensible and\ninexcusable absence from this gala night for the little Daae, at a\nmoment's warning, to show all that she could do in a part of the\nprogram reserved for the Spanish diva!  Well, what the subscribers\nwanted to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daae, when\nCarlotta was taken ill?  Did they know of her hidden genius?  And, if\nthey knew of it, why had they kept it hidden?  And why had she kept it\nhidden?  Oddly enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing\nat that moment.  She had often said she meant to practise alone for the\nfuture.  The whole thing was a mystery.\n\nThe Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all this\nfrenzy and took part in it by loudly applauding.  Philippe Georges\nMarie Comte de Chagny was just forty-one years of age.  He was a great\naristocrat and a good-looking man, above middle height and with\nattractive features, in spite of his hard forehead and his rather cold\neyes.  He was exquisitely polite to the women and a little haughty to\nthe men, who did not always forgive him for his successes in society.\nHe had an excellent heart and an irreproachable conscience.  On the\ndeath of old Count Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest\nand most distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the\nfourteenth century.  The Chagnys owned a great deal of property; and,\nwhen the old count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy task for\nPhilippe to accept the management of so large an estate.  His two\nsisters and his brother, Raoul, would not hear of a division and waived\ntheir claim to their shares, leaving themselves entirely in Philippe's\nhands, as though the right of primogeniture had never ceased to exist.\nWhen the two sisters married, on the same day, they received their\nportion from their brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging to\nthem, but as a dowry for which they thanked him.\n\nThe Comtesse de Chagny, nee de Moerogis de La Martyniere, had died in\ngiving birth to Raoul, who was born twenty years after his elder\nbrother.  At the time of the old count's death, Raoul was twelve years\nof age.  Philippe busied himself actively with the youngster's\neducation.  He was admirably assisted in this work first by his sisters\nand afterward by an old aunt, the widow of a naval officer, who lived\nat Brest and gave young Raoul a taste for the sea.  The lad entered the\nBorda training-ship, finished his course with honors and quietly made\nhis trip round the world.  Thanks to powerful influence, he had just\nbeen appointed a member of the official expedition on board the Requin,\nwhich was to be sent to the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of\nthe D'Artoi's expedition, of whom nothing had been heard for three\nyears.  Meanwhile, he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be\nover for six months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate\nstripling for the hard work in store for him.\n\nThe shyness of the sailor-lad--I was almost saying his innocence--was\nremarkable.  He seemed to have but just left the women's apron-strings.\nAs a matter of fact, petted as he was by his two sisters and his old\naunt, he had retained from this purely feminine education manners that\nwere almost candid and stamped with a charm that nothing had yet been\nable to sully.  He was a little over twenty-one years of age and looked\neighteen.  He had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a\ncomplexion like a girl's.\n\nPhilippe spoiled Raoul.  To begin with, he was very proud of him and\npleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in the navy in\nwhich one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de La Roche, had held\nthe rank of admiral.  He took advantage of the young man's leave of\nabsence to show him Paris, with all its luxurious and artistic\ndelights.  The count considered that, at Raoul's age, it is not good to\nbe too good.  Philippe himself had a character that was very\nwell-balanced in work and pleasure alike; his demeanor was always\nfaultless; and he was incapable of setting his brother a bad example.\nHe took him with him wherever he went.  He even introduced him to the\nfoyer of the ballet.  I know that the count was said to be \"on terms\"\nwith Sorelli.  But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this\nnobleman, a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his\nsisters were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in\nthe company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty, had the\nfinest eyes that ever were seen!  And, besides, there are places where\na true Parisian, when he has the rank of the Comte de Chagny, is bound\nto show himself; and at that time the foyer of the ballet at the Opera\nwas one of those places.\n\nLastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother behind the\nscenes of the Opera if Raoul had not been the first to ask him,\nrepeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy which the count\nremembered at a later date.\n\nOn that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daae, turned to Raoul\nand saw that he was quite pale.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" said Raoul, \"that the woman's fainting?\"\n\n\"You look like fainting yourself,\" said the count.  \"What's the matter?\"\n\nBut Raoul had recovered himself and was standing up.\n\n\"Let's go and see,\" he said, \"she never sang like that before.\"\n\nThe count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed quite\npleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house to the\nstage.  Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their way through.\nRaoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was doing and Philippe\nhad much too kind a heart to laugh at him for his impatience.  But he\nnow understood why Raoul was absent-minded when spoken to and why he\nalways tried to turn every conversation to the subject of the Opera.\n\nThey reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen,\nscene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading the way, feeling\nthat his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set with passion,\nwhile Count Philippe followed him with difficulty and continued to\nsmile.  At the back of the stage, Raoul had to stop before the inrush\nof the little troop of ballet-girls who blocked the passage which he\nwas trying to enter.  More than one chaffing phrase darted from little\nmade-up lips, to which he did not reply; and at last he was able to\npass, and dived into the semi-darkness of a corridor ringing with the\nname of \"Daae!  Daae!\"  The count was surprised to find that Raoul knew\nthe way.  He had never taken him to Christine's himself and came to the\nconclusion that Raoul must have gone there alone while the count stayed\ntalking in the foyer with Sorelli, who often asked him to wait until it\nwas her time to \"go on\" and sometimes handed him the little gaiters in\nwhich she ran down from her dressing-room to preserve the spotlessness\nof her satin dancing-shoes and her flesh-colored tights.  Sorelli had\nan excuse; she had lost her mother.\n\nPostponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the count\nfollowed his brother down the passage that led to Daae's dressing-room\nand saw that it had never been so crammed as on that evening, when the\nwhole house seemed excited by her success and also by her fainting fit.\nFor the girl had not yet come to; and the doctor of the theater had\njust arrived at the moment when Raoul entered at his heels.  Christine,\ntherefore, received the first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in\nthe arms of the other.  The count and many more remained crowding in\nthe doorway.\n\n\"Don't you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better clear the\nroom?\" asked Raoul coolly.  \"There's no breathing here.\"\n\n\"You're quite right,\" said the doctor.\n\nAnd he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who looked at\nRaoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment.  She had never\nseen him before and yet dared not question him; and the doctor imagined\nthat the young man was only acting as he did because he had the right\nto.  The viscount, therefore, remained in the room watching Christine\nas she slowly returned to life, while even the joint managers, Debienne\nand Poligny, who had come to offer their sympathy and congratulations,\nfound themselves thrust into the passage among the crowd of dandies.\nThe Comte de Chagny, who was one of those standing outside, laughed:\n\n\"Oh, the rogue, the rogue!\"  And he added, under his breath: \"Those\nyoungsters with their school-girl airs!  So he's a Chagny after all!\"\n\nHe turned to go to Sorelli's dressing-room, but met her on the way,\nwith her little troop of trembling ballet-girls, as we have seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Christine Daae uttered a deep sigh, which was answered by a\ngroan.  She turned her head, saw Raoul and started.  She looked at the\ndoctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at her maid, then at Raoul\nagain.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, in a voice not much above a whisper, \"who are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" replied the young man, kneeling on one knee and\npressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, \"I AM THE LITTLE BOY WHO\nWENT INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE YOUR SCARF.\"\n\nChristine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all three began\nto laugh.\n\nRaoul turned very red and stood up.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he said, \"since you are pleased not to recognize me, I\nshould like to say something to you in private, something very\nimportant.\"\n\n\"When I am better, do you mind?\"  And her voice shook.  \"You have been\nvery good.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must go,\" said the doctor, with his pleasantest smile.\n\"Leave me to attend to mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"I am not ill now,\" said Christine suddenly, with strange and\nunexpected energy.\n\nShe rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor.  I should like to be alone.  Please go away, all of\nyou.  Leave me.  I feel very restless this evening.\"\n\nThe doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the girl's\nevident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to thwart her.\nAnd he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:\n\n\"She is not herself to-night. She is usually so gentle.\"\n\nThen he said good night and Raoul was left alone.  The whole of this\npart of the theater was now deserted.  The farewell ceremony was no\ndoubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet.  Raoul thought that Daae\nmight go to it and he waited in the silent solitude, even hiding in the\nfavoring shadow of a doorway.  He felt a terrible pain at his heart and\nit was of this that he wanted to speak to Daae without delay.\n\nSuddenly the dressing-room door opened and the maid came out by\nherself, carrying bundles.  He stopped her and asked how her mistress\nwas.  The woman laughed and said that she was quite well, but that he\nmust not disturb her, for she wished to be left alone.  And she passed\non.  One idea alone filled Raoul's burning brain:  of course, Daae\nwished to be left alone FOR HIM!  Had he not told her that he wanted to\nspeak to her privately?\n\nHardly breathing, he went up to the dressing-room and, with his ear to\nthe door to catch her reply, prepared to knock.  But his hand dropped.\nHe had heard A MAN'S VOICE in the dressing-room, saying, in a curiously\nmasterful tone:\n\n\"Christine, you must love me!\"\n\nAnd Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though\naccompanied by tears, replied:\n\n\"How can you talk like that?  WHEN I SING ONLY FOR YOU!\"\n\nRaoul leaned against the panel to ease his pain.  His heart, which had\nseemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was throbbing loudly.\nThe whole passage echoed with its beating and Raoul's ears were\ndeafened.  Surely, if his heart continued to make such a noise, they\nwould hear it inside, they would open the door and the young man would\nbe turned away in disgrace.  What a position for a Chagny!  To be\ncaught listening behind a door!  He took his heart in his two hands to\nmake it stop.\n\nThe man's voice spoke again:  \"Are you very tired?\"\n\n\"Oh, to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead!\"  Christine replied.\n\n\"Your soul is a beautiful thing, child,\" replied the grave man's voice,\n\"and I thank you.  No emperor ever received so fair a gift.  THE ANGELS\nWEPT TONIGHT.\"\n\nRaoul heard nothing after that.  Nevertheless, he did not go away, but,\nas though he feared lest he should be caught, he returned to his dark\ncorner, determined to wait for the man to leave the room.  At one and\nthe same time, he had learned what love meant, and hatred.  He knew\nthat he loved.  He wanted to know whom he hated.  To his great\nastonishment, the door opened and Christine Daae appeared, wrapped in\nfurs, with her face hidden in a lace veil, alone.  She closed the door\nbehind her, but Raoul observed that she did not lock it.  She passed\nhim.  He did not even follow her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed\non the door, which did not open again.\n\nWhen the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened the door\nof the dressing-room, went in and shut the door.  He found himself in\nabsolute darkness.  The gas had been turned out.\n\n\"There is some one here!\" said Raoul, with his back against the closed\ndoor, in a quivering voice.  \"What are you hiding for?\"\n\nAll was darkness and silence.  Raoul heard only the sound of his own\nbreathing.  He quite failed to see that the indiscretion of his conduct\nwas exceeding all bounds.\n\n\"You shan't leave this until I let you!\" he exclaimed.  \"If you don't\nanswer, you are a coward!  But I'll expose you!\"\n\nAnd he struck a match.  The blaze lit up the room.  There was no one in\nthe room!  Raoul, first turning the key in the door, lit the gas-jets.\nHe went into the dressing-closet, opened the cupboards, hunted about,\nfelt the walls with his moist hands.  Nothing!\n\n\"Look here!\" he said, aloud.  \"Am I going mad?\"\n\nHe stood for ten minutes listening to the gas flaring in the silence of\nthe empty room; lover though he was, he did not even think of stealing\na ribbon that would have given him the perfume of the woman he loved.\nHe went out, not knowing what he was doing nor where he was going.  At\na given moment in his wayward progress, an icy draft struck him in the\nface.  He found himself at the bottom of a staircase, down which,\nbehind him, a procession of workmen were carrying a sort of stretcher,\ncovered with a white sheet.\n\n\"Which is the way out, please?\" he asked of one of the men.\n\n\"Straight in front of you, the door is open.  But let us pass.\"\n\nPointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically:  \"What's that?\"\n\nThe workmen answered:\n\n\"'That' is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar, hanging\nbetween a farm-house and a scene from the ROI DE LAHORE.\"\n\nHe took off his hat, fell back to make room for the procession and went\nout."

            "context": "During this time, the farewell ceremony was taking place.  I have\nalready said that this magnificent function was being given on the\noccasion of the retirement of M. Debienne and M. Poligny, who had\ndetermined to \"die game,\" as we say nowadays.  They had been assisted\nin the realization of their ideal, though melancholy, program by all\nthat counted in the social and artistic world of Paris.  All these\npeople met, after the performance, in the foyer of the ballet, where\nSorelli waited for the arrival of the retiring managers with a glass of\nchampagne in her hand and a little prepared speech at the tip of her\ntongue.  Behind her, the members of the Corps de Ballet, young and old,\ndiscussed the events of the day in whispers or exchanged discreet\nsignals with their friends, a noisy crowd of whom surrounded the\nsupper-tables arranged along the slanting floor.\n\nA few of the dancers had already changed into ordinary dress; but most\nof them wore their skirts of gossamer gauze; and all had thought it the\nright thing to put on a special face for the occasion:  all, that is,\nexcept little Jammes, whose fifteen summers--happy age!--seemed already\nto have forgotten the ghost and the death of Joseph Buquet.  She never\nceased to laugh and chatter, to hop about and play practical jokes,\nuntil Mm. Debienne and Poligny appeared on the steps of the foyer, when\nshe was severely called to order by the impatient Sorelli.\n\nEverybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful, as is\nthe Paris way.  None will ever be a true Parisian who has not learned\nto wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of sadness, boredom\nor indifference over his inward joy.  You know that one of your friends\nis in trouble; do not try to console him: he will tell you that he is\nalready comforted; but, should he have met with good fortune, be\ncareful how you congratulate him:  he thinks it so natural that he is\nsurprised that you should speak of it.  In Paris, our lives are one\nmasked ball; and the foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two\nmen so \"knowing\" as M. Debienne and M. Poligny would have made the\nmistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be.  And\nthey were already smiling rather too broadly upon Sorelli, who had\nbegun to recite her speech, when an exclamation from that little madcap\nof a Jammes broke the smile of the managers so brutally that the\nexpression of distress and dismay that lay beneath it became apparent\nto all eyes:\n\n\"The Opera ghost!\"\n\nJammes yelled these words in a tone of unspeakable terror; and her\nfinger pointed, among the crowd of dandies, to a face so pallid, so\nlugubrious and so ugly, with two such deep black cavities under the\nstraddling eyebrows, that the death's head in question immediately\nscored a huge success.\n\n\"The Opera ghost!  The Opera ghost!\"  Everybody laughed and pushed his\nneighbor and wanted to offer the Opera ghost a drink, but he was gone.\nHe had slipped through the crowd; and the others vainly hunted for him,\nwhile two old gentlemen tried to calm little Jammes and while little\nGiry stood screaming like a peacock.\n\nSorelli was furious; she had not been able to finish her speech; the\nmanagers, had kissed her, thanked her and run away as fast as the ghost\nhimself.  No one was surprised at this, for it was known that they were\nto go through the same ceremony on the floor above, in the foyer of the\nsingers, and that finally they were themselves to receive their\npersonal friends, for the last time, in the great lobby outside the\nmanagers' office, where a regular supper would be served.\n\nHere they found the new managers, M. Armand Moncharmin and M. Firmin\nRichard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were lavish in\nprotestations of friendship and received a thousand flattering\ncompliments in reply, so that those of the guests who had feared that\nthey had a rather tedious evening in store for them at once put on\nbrighter faces.  The supper was almost gay and a particularly clever\nspeech of the representative of the government, mingling the glories of\nthe past with the successes of the future, caused the greatest\ncordiality to prevail.\n\nThe retiring managers had already handed over to their successors the\ntwo tiny master-keys which opened all the doors--thousands of doors--of\nthe Opera house.  And those little keys, the object of general\ncuriosity, were being passed from hand to hand, when the attention of\nsome of the guests was diverted by their discovery, at the end of the\ntable, of that strange, wan and fantastic face, with the hollow eyes,\nwhich had already appeared in the foyer of the ballet and been greeted\nby little Jammes' exclamation:\n\n\"The Opera ghost!\"\n\nThere sat the ghost, as natural as could be, except that he neither ate\nnor drank.  Those who began by looking at him with a smile ended by\nturning away their heads, for the sight of him at once provoked the\nmost funereal thoughts.  No one repeated the joke of the foyer, no one\nexclaimed:\n\n\"There's the Opera ghost!\"\n\nHe himself did not speak a word and his very neighbors could not have\nstated at what precise moment he had sat down between them; but every\none felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the table of the\nliving, they could not cut a more ghastly figure.  The friends of\nFirmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin thought that this lean and skinny\nguest was an acquaintance of Debienne's or Poligny's, while Debienne's\nand Poligny's friends believed that the cadaverous individual belonged\nto Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin's party.\n\nThe result was that no request was made for an explanation; no\nunpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have offended this\nvisitor from the tomb.  A few of those present who knew the story of\nthe ghost and the description of him given by the chief\nscene-shifter--they did not know of Joseph Buquet's death--thought, in\ntheir own minds, that the man at the end of the table might easily have\npassed for him; and yet, according to the story, the ghost had no nose\nand the person in question had.  But M. Moncharmin declares, in his\nMemoirs, that the guest's nose was transparent:  \"long, thin and\ntransparent\" are his exact words.  I, for my part, will add that this\nmight very well apply to a false nose.  M. Moncharmin may have taken\nfor transparency what was only shininess.  Everybody knows that\northopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for those who have\nlost their noses naturally or as the result of an operation.\n\nDid the ghost really take a seat at the managers' supper-table that\nnight, uninvited?  And can we be sure that the figure was that of the\nOpera ghost himself?  Who would venture to assert as much?  I mention\nthe incident, not because I wish for a second to make the reader\nbelieve--or even to try to make him believe--that the ghost was capable\nof such a sublime piece of impudence; but because, after all, the thing\nis impossible.\n\nM. Armand Moncharmin, in chapter eleven of his Memoirs, says:\n\n\"When I think of this first evening, I can not separate the secret\nconfided to us by MM. Debienne and Poligny in their office from the\npresence at our supper of that GHOSTLY person whom none of us knew.\"\n\nWhat happened was this:  Mm. Debienne and Poligny, sitting at the\ncenter of the table, had not seen the man with the death's head.\nSuddenly he began to speak.\n\n\"The ballet-girls are right,\" he said.  \"The death of that poor Buquet\nis perhaps not so natural as people think.\"\n\nDebienne and Poligny gave a start.\n\n\"Is Buquet dead?\" they cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man, or the shadow of a man, quietly.  \"He was\nfound, this evening, hanging in the third cellar, between a farm-house\nand a scene from the Roi de Lahore.\"\n\nThe two managers, or rather ex-managers, at once rose and stared\nstrangely at the speaker.  They were more excited than they need have\nbeen, that is to say, more excited than any one need be by the\nannouncement of the suicide of a chief scene-shifter. They looked at\neach other.  They, had both turned whiter than the table-cloth.  At\nlast, Debienne made a sign to Mm. Richard and Moncharmin; Poligny\nmuttered a few words of excuse to the guests; and all four went into\nthe managers' office.  I leave M. Moncharmin to complete the story.  In\nhis Memoirs, he says:\n\n\"Mm. Debienne and Poligny seemed to grow more and more excited, and\nthey appeared to have something very difficult to tell us.  First, they\nasked us if we knew the man, sitting at the end of the table, who had\ntold them of the death of Joseph Buquet; and, when we answered in the\nnegative, they looked still more concerned.  They took the master-keys\nfrom our hands, stared at them for a moment and advised us to have new\nlocks made, with the greatest secrecy, for the rooms, closets and\npresses that we might wish to have hermetically closed.  They said this\nso funnily that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thieves at\nthe Opera.  They replied that there was something worse, which was the\nGHOST.  We began to laugh again, feeling sure that they were indulging\nin some joke that was intended to crown our little entertainment.\nThen, at their request, we became 'serious,' resolving to humor them\nand to enter into the spirit of the game.  They told us that they never\nwould have spoken to us of the ghost, if they had not received formal\norders from the ghost himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to\ngrant any request that he might make.  However, in their relief at\nleaving a domain where that tyrannical shade held sway, they had\nhesitated until the last moment to tell us this curious story, which\nour skeptical minds were certainly not prepared to entertain.  But the\nannouncement of the death of Joseph Buquet had served them as a brutal\nreminder that, whenever they had disregarded the ghost's wishes, some\nfantastic or disastrous event had brought them to a sense of their\ndependence.\n\n\"During these unexpected utterances made in a tone of the most secret\nand important confidence, I looked at Richard.  Richard, in his student\ndays, had acquired a great reputation for practical joking, and he\nseemed to relish the dish which was being served up to him in his turn.\nHe did not miss a morsel of it, though the seasoning was a little\ngruesome because of the death of Buquet.  He nodded his head sadly,\nwhile the others spoke, and his features assumed the air of a man who\nbitterly regretted having taken over the Opera, now that he knew that\nthere was a ghost mixed up in the business.  I could think of nothing\nbetter than to give him a servile imitation of this attitude of\ndespair.  However, in spite of all our efforts, we could not, at the\nfinish, help bursting out laughing in the faces of MM. Debienne and\nPoligny, who, seeing us pass straight from the gloomiest state of mind\nto one of the most insolent merriment, acted as though they thought\nthat we had gone mad.\n\n\"The joke became a little tedious; and Richard asked half-seriously and\nhalf in jest:\n\n\"'But, after all, what does this ghost of yours want?'\n\n\"M. Poligny went to his desk and returned with a copy of the\nmemorandum-book. The memorandum-book begins with the well-known words\nsaying that 'the management of the Opera shall give to the performance\nof the National Academy of Music the splendor that becomes the first\nlyric stage in France' and ends with Clause 98, which says that the\nprivilege can be withdrawn if the manager infringes the conditions\nstipulated in the memorandum-book.  This is followed by the conditions,\nwhich are four in number.\n\n\"The copy produced by M. Poligny was written in black ink and exactly\nsimilar to that in our possession, except that, at the end, it\ncontained a paragraph in red ink and in a queer, labored handwriting,\nas though it had been produced by dipping the heads of matches into the\nink, the writing of a child that has never got beyond the down-strokes\nand has not learned to join its letters.  This paragraph ran, word for\nword, as follows:\n\n\"'5. Or if the manager, in any month, delay for more than a fortnight\nthe payment of the allowance which he shall make to the Opera ghost, an\nallowance of twenty thousand francs a month, say two hundred and forty\nthousand francs a year.'\n\n\"M. Poligny pointed with a hesitating finger to this last clause, which\nwe certainly did not expect.\n\n\"'Is this all?  Does he not want anything else?' asked Richard, with\nthe greatest coolness.\n\n\"'Yes, he does,' replied Poligny.\n\n\"And he turned over the pages of the memorandum-book until he came to\nthe clause specifying the days on which certain private boxes were to\nbe reserved for the free use of the president of the republic, the\nministers and so on.  At the end of this clause, a line had been added,\nalso in red ink:\n\n\"'Box Five on the grand tier shall be placed at the disposal of the\nOpera ghost for every performance.'\n\n\"When we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to rise from\nour chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the hand and\ncongratulate them on thinking of this charming little joke, which\nproved that the old French sense of humor was never likely to become\nextinct.  Richard added that he now understood why MM.  Debienne and\nPoligny were retiring from the management of the National Academy of\nMusic.  Business was impossible with so unreasonable a ghost.\n\n\"'Certainly, two hundred and forty thousand francs are not be picked up\nfor the asking,' said M. Poligny, without moving a muscle of his face.\n'And have you considered what the loss over Box Five meant to us?  We\ndid not sell it once; and not only that, but we had to return the\nsubscription:  why, it's awful!  We really can't work to keep ghosts!\nWe prefer to go away!'\n\n\"'Yes,' echoed M. Debienne, 'we prefer to go away.  Let us go.'\"\n\n\"And he stood up.  Richard said:  'But, after all all, it seems to me\nthat you were much too kind to the ghost.  If I had such a troublesome\nghost as that, I should not hesitate to have him arrested.'\n\n\"'But how?  Where?' they cried, in chorus.  'We have never seen him!'\n\n\"'But when he comes to his box?'\n\n\"'WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN HIS BOX.'\n\n\"'Then sell it.'\n\n\"'Sell the Opera ghost's box!  Well, gentlemen, try it.'\n\n\"Thereupon we all four left the office.  Richard and I had 'never\nlaughed so much in our lives.'\""

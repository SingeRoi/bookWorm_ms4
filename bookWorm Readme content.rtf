##About bookWorm. \par
\par
This a prototype e-commerce site for promotion of inclusive new literature in the competitive e-novels/comics market. \par
\par
Site users can browse titles according to type (book, comic) or genre (sci-fi, fantasy or historical). After registration and login users can read sample chapters and then choose to purchase further chapters or a subscription. Users can then review the products they buy. Users can also submit their own works for online publication and/or may offer to act as translators for new works users will receive payment for this. \par
\par
## Demo\par
\par
![Project Demo](/UXD/Demo.png)\par
### Design choices\par
The beginning of the design process was the bookWorm brand logo which uses a strong blue. From this to provide a fresh look I chose a palette based on shades of blue and green selected using the palette tool at [Coolors)(). Many aspects of the design use bootstrap components for consistency but to give a modern look they have been restyled as, for example, the navbar toggler button which has no border in order to give it a more contemporary look. The font choice for the logo, was determined by experimentation using [Fontastic]() and provides an appealing visual pun.  The design seeks to provide a visually consistent, responsive and easy to navigate user experience.\par
## UX\par
\par
I looked at the other project ideas given by the Code Institute and worked them into my idea: \par
\par
**Potential features to include:**\par
* An online store focused on selling new eLiterature\par
\par
* Allow users to search items based on various fields, e.g. type, genre, author, rating\par
\par
* Allow users to filter items based on title, genre, language, rating\par
\par
* Allow users to see the price, image, ratings and other basic details of titles on the search page\par
\par
* When viewing a title, users would be able to identify its content and suitability, read a sample, purchase more material, leave a rating\par
\par
* Allow users to securely purchase title chapters, allow authors/translators to receive payments\par
\par
* Users have to be registered to purchase, rate, create or translate \par
\par
* Allow registered users to write reviews about the titles, only if they purchased them\par
\par
* Include pagination and/or other dynamic and responsive display actions.\par
\par
\par
### User Stories\par
\par
This site is intended for readers and creators of new eNovels, eComics and other literary works in the growing foreign language publications market of east Asia. These publications re typically provided on a chapter by chapter basis offereing novel challenges in terms of dealing with management and presentation of products.\par
**_"As administrator I would like to"_**\par

* attract new titles and provide a mechanism for translation of new works \par
 * generate ongoing interest in the site & build a reader/writer community\par
* make a profit from selling access to chapters and/or subscriptions to titles\par
* securely collect/make payments for works\par
\par

**_"As an author I would like to"_**\par
\par
### Design\par
\par
I wanted to style the website with a fresh, inviting colour palette. It seekd to promote easy navigation through consistent use f well recognised icons in standard locations. In partcular when hadling very large numbers of products and large blocks of text there is a need to provide suitable navigation buttons that react responsively. \par
\par
#### Colour Scheme\par
\par
![Colour Palette](UXD/colour-palette.png)\par

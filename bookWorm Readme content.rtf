# Code Institute Milestone Project \par
## Full Stack Framework with Django \par

\par
##About bookWorm. \par
\par
This a prototype e-commerce site for promotion of inclusive new literature in the competitive e-novels/comics market. \par
\par
Site users can browse titles according to type (book, comic) or genre (sci-fi, fantasy or historical). After registration and login users can read sample chapters and then choose to purchase further chapters or a subscription. Users can then review the products they buy. Users can also submit their own works for online publication and/or may offer to act as translators for new works users will receive payment for this. \par
\par
## Demo\par

\par
## UX\par
\par
I looked at the other project ideas given by the Code Institute and worked them into my idea: \par
\par
**Potential features to include:**\par
* An online store focused on selling new eLiterature\par
\par
* Allow users to search items based on various fields, e.g. type, genre, author, rating\par
\par
* Allow users to filter items based on title, genre, language, rating\par
\par
* Allow users to see the price, image, ratings and other basic details of titles on the search page\par
\par
* When viewing a title, users would be able to identify its content and suitability, read a sample, purchase more material, leave a rating\par
\par
* Allow users to securely purchase title chapters, allow authors/translators to receive payments\par
\par
* Users have to be registered to purchase, rate, create or translate \par
\par
* Allow registered users to write reviews about the titles, only if they purchased them\par
\par
* Include pagination and/or other dynamic and responsive display actions.\par
\par
\par
